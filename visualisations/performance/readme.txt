This web page contains all 5 visualisations and playback is controlled via the keyboard. The controls are:

1: load Boolen vis
2: load Debugging Pt.1 vis
3: load Debugging Pt.2 vis
4: load Debugging Pt.3 vis
5: load Debugging Pt.4 vis
6: load Debugging Pt.5 vis
7: load Algorithms vis
8: load Big Data vis
9: load Computational Thinking vis

s: start playback
a: fade and end playback


So typically you'll press a number to preload the vis, then 's' to start playback.

If you wish to combine this page with the live Kinect stream, you must start KinectServer running on localhost:8111
and use the live.html variant.
